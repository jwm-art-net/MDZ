mdz-0.1.2

CHANGES:

* Estimate number of threads to use based upon
  information in /proc (or revert to 2).

* Colour randomization settings now saved in
  file (so now get transmitted to new windows).

* File Load/Save dialogs now remember last used
  directory & filename. PNG save takes name from
  last used MDZ directory/filename.

FIXES:

* Avoid seg-fault by waiting for all render threads
  to finish before loading an MDZ file.

* Update "Zoom in new window" checkbox after
  using "Reset zoom".

* Update colour scale value in palette dialog after
  'Reset zoom'.

* Load settings file before processing command line
  options which specifiy width or height or aspect
  ratio. This fixes unexpected behaviour when only
  height was specified alongside a file with a non
  default aspect ratio.

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.1.1

CHANGES

* PNG images are now always saved in the RGB format.
  This solves the problem of the inside-colour being
  black in MDZ but some other colour if the image was
  saved without colour-interpolation or anti-aliasing,
  as well as the palette offset bug in saved images.

* Renamed 'variant' fractal type to 'mandel-celtic-hybrid'.

* Added a couple of example colour palettes saved in
  .map format in gallery/.

* Added a couple of mandel-celtic hybrid example settings
  files in gallery/.

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.1.0

NEW FEATURES:

* Three new fractal types, Burning Ship, Generalized
  Celtic, and Variant. See README.

* New Correct Rounding option - when not
  set uses slightly faster multi-precision
  maths routines than previous versions.
  (ie it uses GMP instead of MPFR). See README.

CHANGES:

* Added non-rounding precision label in Attributes
  dialog. See README.

* MDZ settings files created with mdz-0.1.0 are
  not compatible with older versions of MDZ, but
  older files are still readable with mdz-0.1.0.

* Randomize button is now always visibile (I'm
  trialling this, please give feedback)

FIXES:

* Increased minimum precision to 2 bits to prevent
  MPFR assertion failure ;-)

* Palette offset setting in MDZ files no longer
  ignored.

* Image dimensions, anti-aliasing, and thread count
  not lost in new instance created by duplicate and
  zoom-in-new-window menu commands.

* Loading of an MDZ settings file no longer resets
  anti-aliasing.

* Fix in mdz file test-read routine which was
  previously non-apparent.

* Fix for my_mpfr_to_str routine (for older versions
  of MPFR) to include exponent in output string.
  

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.9


NEW FEATURES:

* Random palette, Palette functions, colour
  cycling, and colour scaling dialogs combined into
  a single notebook dialog.

* New palette notebook dialog displays all colours
  in palette as a horizontal strip.

* Palette display is updated as palette is edited
  and/or cycled.

* Point and click sliding of colour palette with
  image update.


CHANGES:

* Removed externs.h and globals.c (which only
  declared and defined the variable palette).

* Changed 'recommended' precision label in
  attributes dialog to 'scant minimum' as this
  better reflects what the value is (or seems to
  be in my opinion).


FIXES:

* Fixed various memory leaks related to coordinates
  calculation.

* Reams of cut-and-pasted code in the construction
  of the palette dialogs has been replaced with generic
  functions.


-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.8

Minor bug fix release.

* Bug fix for coordinates precision means
  coordinates precision are now updated
  when precision changed.

* Duplicate/Zoom-in-new-window no longer
  dumps the settings to stdout.

* VERSION now set in src/Makefile

* Added dist target to src/Makefile to
  generate mdz-$(VERSION).tar.bz2 (probably
  in a non standard manner)

* Added --version commandline option

* Show version in main window title bar,
  and output to settings file in comment

* Added some strangeness in image_info.c
  lines 310,311...

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.7

Compatible with MPFR versions 2.3 to 3.0
Tested on 64bit Debian Lenny and Gentoo ~amd64.

NEW FEATURES:

* Coordinates system now uses center and
  size as a location reference point.

* New coordinates dialog shows and allows
  editing of exact coordinates of image.

* MDZ files now store coordinates as cx, cy,
  and size and writes xmin, xmax, ymax as
  comments in the file.

* Transparent handling of old-style MDZ files
  and new style.

* Ability to load an mdz file without loading
  the palette data.

* Ability to load only the palette data from
  an MDZ file without loading the fractal
  settings.

* MDZ files can now contain comments. To make
  a comment the line must start with the
  # character.

* Ability to change number of render threads
  from within the Attributes dialog.

FIXES:

* File filters added to file choosers making
  extensions of files more obvious.

* Julia sets now drawn in the middle of the
  windows (unless repositioned or zoomed of
  course).

* Independent Julia and Mandelbrot coordinates
  don't effect each other when zooming.

* Refactoring of settings loading.

* Now defaults to 2 threads instead of 64. While
  this is slower, it has the benefit of not
  slowing your entire system down.

NEW SRC FILES:

  coords.h + coords.c  contains the calculations
  for the coordinates, some unfinished precision
  stuff, and more calculations for the coordinates
  system.

  setting.h + setting.c contains a handful of
  functions for transferring textual data into
  some other type such as double, long, array index,
  mpfr_t etc.

  mdzfileio.h mdzfileio.c contains mostly just
  useful functions for reading MDZ files.

  coords_gui.h + coords_gui.c just the GTK code for
  creating the coordinates dialog. <whisper>I'm
  quite pleased with how I did it...</whisper>

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.6

* locales which use commas for decimal
  places (as opposed to dots) caused problems
  for load/save of mdz files. the mdz files
  are now written and read with the program
  set to the "C" locale. Once read/write is
  done, the program goes back to the
  system locale.

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.5b ----> another bug fix release

* fixed attributes dialog: when turning on
  arbitrary precision maths, any change in
  the precision setting was ignored.

* fixed --render command line option: the
  image rendered is actually saved again!
  stupid me (as it was if the image had of
  been saved, it would likely be missing a
  few lines, but fixed this too).

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.5

* fixed: seg fault caused bye rth_ui_quit
  overwriting RT_RENDERING instead of or-ing
  it (consequently rendering continued while
  memory and thread data was freed).

* 1 click zooming no longer disables the
  zoom out button.

* fixed: loading mdz settings files from
  within the GUI now sets use of arbitrary
  precision maths routines properly.

* zooming behaviour modified so zoom boxes
  are drawn with the mouse pointer central
  to them, instead of at the top-left corner.
  1 click zooming no longer uses center lines
  but a fixed size zoom box.

* modified tooltips for zoom buttons in toolbar.
  changed "depth" label to "iters".

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.4

* fixed: zoom boxes and center lines no
  longer leave any artifacts in the image
  window during redraw or from expose
  events.

* new: multi-threading. my first foray into
  multi-threaded programming. i've tested it
  extensively it seems to work for me, both
  on 64bit dual core and 32bit single core
  machines (x86). almost halves rendering
  speed on both machines tested compared
  with mdz-0.0.3.

* new: 1 click super zoom. press the button
  on the toolbar and just click a point to
  zoom right the way in on.

* inside points within the M-set are always
  coloured black.

* *lots* of code changes to accommodate
  multi-threading.


-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.3

+ fixed: the buffer length for reading text
  from the settings file was too small for
  really deep zooms! (was: 80 now: 4096)

+ fixed: colour-interpolate setting was
  ignored when loading a settings file.

+ plethora of command line options
  to load settings, load palette,
  generate a random palette, log settings
  to a file while using the program,
  image width, height, and aspect ratio,
  file to render to.

+ first iteration is 1 instead of 0.

+ duplicate window, and zoom in new window
  re-implemented and working.

+ lots of code changes, rearrangements and
  additions to implement all of above, too
  many for me to remember.

+ default location set as default location
  of mandelbrot default in Fractint.

+ fixed typo in save settings code - note
  this breaks old settings files - which
  are broken by other stuff anyway - but
  can be edited in your favourite text
  editor!

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.2-fixes.patch

+ fixed: segfault caused by image_info struct
  not being initialized because the memset
  was commented out.

+ fixed: memory allocation for the palette
  filename was 1 byte too small.

+ fixed: valid paths for system wide palette
  files was not free()d.

Thanks to Alexandre Prokoudine for reporting
a seg-fault which occured on 64bit Ubuntu 9.10
as a result of the above bugs.

+ fixed: compilation against mpfr-2.3. mpfr-2.3
  lacks mpfr_div_d function - use preprocessor
  directive for conditional compilation of
  workaround when using mpfr-2.3 (this only
  effects the repositioning code, NOT the
  main fractal iteration loops).

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.2

+ load/save settings (text file format)
+ load/save of colour maps
+ gui enhancements
+ preliminary gui seperation

-------------------------------------------
mdz-0.0.1
-----\__ initial release

ripped the guts out of gkII - removed everything
which distracts for exploration of the standard
Mandelbrot-Set

added usage of MPFR library.
